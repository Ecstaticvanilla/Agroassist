|- gitignore and readme

Apne files and features aise daalo ki baaki can also put accordingly. try to keep everything modular and sorted. chahiye to gpt pe dekh lo dir struc for react + flask + python site 

always put venv, node_modules and pycache jaise dirs in gitignore.
IDEs ka data (like user profile metadata etc), khudke pc ka data etc. mat daalo... all of that goes in gitignore.

middleware ka i dont hv any idea yet.. will update accordingly.
